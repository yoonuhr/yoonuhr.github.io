# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PurdueRide Backend is a Node.js/Express API server that provides authentication, ride management, and user services for the PurdueRide ride-sharing application. The backend serves Purdue University students with a secure, scalable platform for requesting and managing rides around campus and West Lafayette. The system supports fixed-price ($3) rides, JWT-based authentication, real-time ride status updates, and comprehensive user management with Purdue email verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a Purdue student, I want to securely register and login to the PurdueRide system using my Purdue email, so that I can access ride services with verified student status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user registers with a non-Purdue email THEN the system SHALL reject the registration with appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT access token and refresh token
4. WHEN a user provides invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
5. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL allow token refresh using the refresh token
6. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the current session tokens
7. WHEN accessing protected endpoints without valid authentication THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 2: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to manage my profile information and verify my student status, so that I can maintain accurate account details and access full platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their profile THEN the system SHALL return current user information including verification status
2. WHEN a user updates profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes with updated timestamp
3. WHEN a user uploads a profile picture THEN the system SHALL store the image securely and update the profile
4. WHEN profile validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific field-level error messages
5. WHEN a user initiates verification THEN the system SHALL update verification status to pending
6. WHEN verification is completed THEN the system SHALL update user status to verified or rejected

### Requirement 3: Ride Management System

**User Story:** As a driver, I want to create and manage ride offerings, so that students can book rides at the fixed $3 price point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verified driver creates a ride THEN the system SHALL store ride details with available status
2. WHEN creating a ride THEN the system SHALL validate pickup location, destination, scheduled time, and seat capacity
3. WHEN a ride is created THEN the system SHALL set the cost to exactly $3.00
4. WHEN a ride reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL automatically update status to full
5. WHEN a ride time passes THEN the system SHALL update status to completed or cancelled as appropriate
6. WHEN retrieving available rides THEN the system SHALL return only rides with available or in-progress status
7. WHEN a ride is cancelled THEN the system SHALL notify all passengers and update status

### Requirement 4: Ride Request Processing

**User Story:** As a student, I want to request rides and track their status, so that I can get transportation around campus reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a ride request THEN the system SHALL validate pickup location and passenger count
2. WHEN a ride request is valid THEN the system SHALL create the request with pending status
3. WHEN a ride request is confirmed THEN the system SHALL update status and reduce available seats
4. WHEN a user cancels a ride request THEN the system SHALL update status and restore available seats
5. WHEN retrieving ride history THEN the system SHALL return user's past rides and requests sorted by date
6. WHEN a ride status changes THEN the system SHALL update the database with timestamp
7. WHEN special instructions are provided THEN the system SHALL store and make them available to the driver

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data storage with proper validation, so that the platform maintains data integrity and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data is saved THEN the system SHALL validate against defined schemas before persistence
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and return appropriate error responses
3. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL use proper indexes for optimal performance
4. WHEN user passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds or leverage Supabase Auth for secure password management
5. WHEN sensitive data is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper authorization checks using Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
6. WHEN data relationships exist THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity using PostgreSQL foreign key constraints
7. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL handle connection pooling and timeouts through Supabase client configuration

### Requirement 6: Security and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive security measures in place, so that user data is protected and the system is resilient against attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input data
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limiting per user/IP
3. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL allow only configured origins
4. WHEN HTTP headers are sent THEN the system SHALL include security headers via Helmet middleware
5. WHEN authentication tokens are generated THEN the system SHALL use Supabase Auth's secure JWT token generation
6. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log security events
7. WHEN SQL injection attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL reject the request and log the attempt, leveraging Supabase's built-in SQL injection protection

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer and system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor system health and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
2. WHEN client errors happen THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages without exposing internals
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request details for monitoring
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt recovery
6. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific field-level error details
